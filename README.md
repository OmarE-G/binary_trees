### Binary Trees Learning Project

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for various binary tree operations as part of the ALX SWE School curriculum.

### About

This project serves as a practical exercise in understanding and implementing various operations on binary trees. Each file contains a specific function related to binary tree manipulation, designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in working with binary trees.

Feel free to explore the files and use them for your learning purposes!
